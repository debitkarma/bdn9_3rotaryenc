# QMK Config - BDN9 Rev2 w/ 3 Rotary Encs

This is a repo for the configuration of the firmware for a [keeb.io BDN9 Revision 2 Macropad](https://docs.keeb.io/bdn9-rev2-build-guide), which supports up 3 rotary encoders in the top 3 slots (the top row). I have all 3 installed, so this is to build fw for my specific situation.
